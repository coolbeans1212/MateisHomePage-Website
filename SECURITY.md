# Security Policy
<!-- This is a Markdown header for the main title of the section, indicating it's the "Security Policy" of the website -->

## Supported Versions
<!-- This is a subheader under the "Security Policy" title, introducing the section about supported versions of the website -->

The following versions are being updated with security and feature updates.
<!-- This line explains that the listed versions will receive updates, both for security and new features -->

| Version               | Supported          | 
| --------------------- | ------------------ | 
| all of them           | :white_check_mark: | 
| literally the only one | :white_check_mark: |
<!-- This table lists versions that are supported. The ":white_check_mark:" emoji indicates that all versions are supported -->
<!-- "all of them" and "literally the only one" are both marked with a check, indicating they are updated -->

## Reporting a Vulnerability
<!-- Another subheader, this time for the section explaining how to report vulnerabilities -->

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability... if you dare (mwahahahahahahahaha)<br> 
<!-- This is a lighthearted sentence, asking people to report vulnerabilities with a sense of humor; the <br> is used for a line break in HTML -->
<!-- "mwahahahahahahahaha" is a playful villainous laugh for comic effect -->

<!-- A more serious request, saying that the user should report any vulnerabilities, accompanied by an emoji (":pensive:") to convey sadness -->
